I love movies with Tom Hanks and Leonardo DiCaprio. My favorite genres are drama and thriller. I really enjoyed Inception, The Shawshank Redemption, and Interstellar. I don't like horror movies or romantic comedies. I prefer films from the 1990s through 2010s. Please recommend 5 movies I might enjoy.
